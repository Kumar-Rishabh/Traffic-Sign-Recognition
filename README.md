# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
This is project where we recognize the traffic sign using deep learning.

we have built a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.

Dataset

We have used GTSRB-German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.it has more than 50000 images of traffic signs which is divided into 43 different categories.

For training the model run the Traffic_Sign_Recognition.ipynb file.

After training the model we have built a GUI for the same.We have used TKinter to make the GUI.

run the gui.ipynb to get the GUI for traffic Sign prediction.
